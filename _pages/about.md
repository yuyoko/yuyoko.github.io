I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Physics at the University of Pittsburgh, with a research focus in biophysicsâ€”specifically, understanding cellular dynamics. My work lies at the intersection of statistical physics, machine learning, and cell biology, aiming to uncover principles governing cell behavior by analyzing image-based data. Currently, my primary project involves applying deep learning models to study and characterize cell cycle dynamics from microscopy images.

I am fortunate to be advised by **Professor Jianhua Xing**, who holds joint appointments in the  
Department of Computational and Systems Biology (School of Medicine) and the  
Department of Physics and Astronomy (School of Arts & Sciences) at the University of Pittsburgh.
